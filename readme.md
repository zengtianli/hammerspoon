## Prerequisites

- **macOS**: The scripts are tailored for macOS, leveraging the capabilities of Hammerspoon.
  
- **Hammerspoon**: Ensure that you have [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) installed. It's a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine.

## Installation

1. **Clone this Repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zengtianli/hammerspoon.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to Hammerspoon Configuration Folder**:
    ```bash
    cd ~/.hammerspoon/
    ```

3. **Copy the Script**: Move the cloned Lua script to the Hammerspoon configuration directory or incorporate its functionalities into your existing `init.lua`.

4. **Reload Hammerspoon**: Use the Hammerspoon menu icon to reload the configuration or press the default `cmd + ctrl + shift + reload` key combination.
